# Want to do some of the extra exercises?

## React router

Problem: I want to see the individual `post` page when I click the `visit` button, but I can't!

Your job is implement the correct routing strategy to see something like this: https://router-redux.netlify.app/blog/1

Modify the files that you require. 

Attach your PR url to the moodle task and don't forget to attach a gif to show that everything works cool.

## Redux

Problem: We don't want to manage the state of the `blog` and `blogPost` views in the component state!

Your job is integrate create the required redux components to manage the state and consume it in the views (the views will be connected to the store)

Attach your PR url to the moodle task and don't forget to attach a gif to show that everything works cool.
